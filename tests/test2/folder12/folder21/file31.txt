In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
I hitched a ride, up to the coast
To leave behind, all of my ghosts
Searching for something, I couldn't find at home
Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time
In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
When it gets dark, in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head, will soon be fed
By the vultures that circle round the dead
In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
I never once thought, I'd ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks, hiding my track marks
I left my best friends or did they just leave me
In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
